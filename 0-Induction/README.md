# React Learning Roadmap

👋 Welcome! I’m Chhoton Choudhury and this is my topic-wise journey to master **React.js** — built like a professional course and pushed live as I learn and grow.

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here

- 🧠 My understanding of each React topic
- 🛠️ Projects & code examples for each concept
- 💬 My personal notes, doubts, and solutions
- ✅ Only pushed after I truly understood each concept

---

## 📌 Why This Repo?

I want to:

- Build a deep understanding of React
- Document my learning publicly
- Show real progress as a developer
- Help others learn through my examples

---

## 📖 Structure

Each folder has:

- 📄 `README.md` (explained notes + tasks)
- 💻 Code folder (React app, code samples)

---

## 🚀 Progress Tracking
